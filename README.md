<h1>👨‍💻 Satyam | Software Developer</h1>

🚀 Passionate Software Engineer with deep hands-on experience in building scalable, efficient, and robust applications using modern development stacks. With a strong foundation in systems design, backend architecture, and performance tuning, I enjoy solving complex problems using clean, bug-free code.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🧠 **Backend Development (Go)**
  - Expert in writing high-performance, concurrent Go services.
  - Deep dive into channels, mutexes, and optimizing goroutines.
  - Built and maintained production-grade REST APIs and WebSocket servers.

- 🧩 **Frontend Engineering**
  - Developed responsive UIs using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
  - Integrated dynamic rendering with backend data pipelines.

- 📡 **Messaging & Realtime Communication**
  - Built microservices communicating over **NATS**, **WebSocket**, and HTTP.
  - Designed event-driven architectures using publish/subscribe models.

- 🐘 **Database & Data Access**
  - Proficient with PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MySQL – schema design to query optimization.
  - DAO service management and interfacing with REST layers.

- 🐳 **Containerization & Orchestration**
  - All services containerized using `scratch` base image (fully minimal Docker builds).
  - Configured Docker Compose setups with multi-service dependency management.

- 🧪 **Testing & CI/CD**
  - Designed and automated test cases using Python + Selenium.
  - Built robust GitHub-based CI/CD pipelines for dev → staging → prod flows.
